# Don't Panic When Debugging
## Take a deep breath and THINK! about what could be causing the symptoms that you believe indicate a bug.

I once spent 3 hours frantically debugging what seemed like a database connection issue. The application would randomly fail to retrieve user data, but only in production. I was diving deep into connection pooling configurations and database logs.

Finally, I stepped back and took a deep breath. I realized I was panicking and not thinking clearly. When I calmly traced through the code path, I discovered it was actually a caching issue - the cache was returning stale data when the database was updated. The fix took 5 minutes once I identified the real problem.

The lesson: panic makes you tunnel vision on symptoms instead of root causes.

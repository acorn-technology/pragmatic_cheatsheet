# DRYâ€”Don't Repeat Yourself
## Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

I was maintaining a React application where the same user validation logic was copied across 5 different components. When the requirements changed to add email format validation, I had to hunt down and update each copy. I missed one, and it caused a production bug.

The fix was simple - extract the validation logic into a custom hook. Now there's one source of truth for user validation, and changes only need to happen in one place. The DRY principle saved us from countless future bugs and maintenance headaches.

During a code review, I noticed a junior developer had copy-pasted a complex database query function across multiple service files. Each copy had slight variations for different use cases.

I suggested we create a generic query builder function with parameters for the different use cases. This not only eliminated the duplication but made the code more testable and easier to understand. The junior developer said it was a lightbulb moment for understanding how abstraction and DRY work together.

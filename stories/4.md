# Don't Live with Broken Windows
## Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.

---
I once worked on a project where we had a small bug in the user authentication system - sometimes users would get logged out randomly. The team said "it's not critical, we'll fix it later." But that "later" never came. 

Soon, other small bugs started piling up. The random logout became the norm, then we started accepting other "small" issues like slow page loads and occasionally broken forms. Before we knew it, our entire application felt unreliable.

It wasn't until a new team lead joined and insisted we fix the authentication bug first that things turned around. Once we fixed that "broken window," the team's attitude shifted and we started taking pride in our code quality again.

At my startup, we had a legacy codebase with no tests and inconsistent coding standards. When I joined as a senior developer, I could have just worked around these issues like everyone else was doing.

Instead, I started small - I wrote tests for the module I was working on and refactored just that piece to follow consistent patterns. Other developers noticed and started doing the same. Within six months, we had transformed our entire development culture simply by not accepting the "broken windows" anymore.
